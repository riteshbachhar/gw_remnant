# gw_remnant

During binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers, energy and momenta are carried away from the binary system as gravitational radiation. Access to the radiated energy and momenta allows us to accurately predict the properties of the remnant black hole. 

```gw_remnant``` is an easy-to-use python package to efficiently extract the remnant mass, remnant spin, peak luminosity and the final kick imparted on the remnant black hole directly from the gravitational radiation.

Github repo for this project is : ```https://github.com/tousifislam/gw_remnant```

Currently it has the ability to generate waveforms from ```NRHybSur3dq8``` and ```BHPTNRSur1dq1e4```. However, it can take waveforms generated by other methods by the user too. 

## Tutorials

Example notebook is provided in ```gw_remnant/tutorials``` directory.
